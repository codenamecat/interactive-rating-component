# interactive-rating-component
Project from Frontend Mentor: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI

My first small JavaScript project. Very simple one in hindsight, so of course I had to add to it. After making it work, I added an error message that pops up if the user hasn't chosen a rating before trying to submit and restructured the project to (hopefully) follow the MVC architecture.

I styled the project using Sass. Here's a combined screenshot of the two cards:
