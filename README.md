# interactive-rating-component
Project from Frontend Mentor

My first small JavaScript project, here's the original challenge: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI

Very simple project in hindsight, so of course I had to challenge myself. After making it work, I added an error message if the user hasn't chosen a rating and restructured the project to (hopefully) follow the MVC architecture.
